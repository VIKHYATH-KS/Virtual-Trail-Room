# Virtual Trial Room: Real-World Path Exploration Through Webcam Interface

## Overview
The **Virtual Trial Room** is an advanced web-based application that allows users to try on clothing in real-time using a webcam. By leveraging **pose estimation, homography transformations, and augmented reality techniques**, the system overlays selected clothing onto the userâ€™s detected body, providing a seamless and interactive virtual fitting experience.

## Features
- **Real-Time Pose Estimation**: Detects key body landmarks for accurate clothing alignment.
- **Background Removal**: Enhances clothing overlay by isolating the user from the surroundings.
- **Virtual Clothing Try-On**: Allows users to select and apply garments dynamically.
- **Homography Transformation**: Ensures correct scaling and perspective for realistic fitting.
- **Interactive UI**: Users can adjust clothing size, swap outfits, and view themselves in different styles.
- **Optimized for Performance**: GPU acceleration for smooth real-time rendering.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy navigation and intuitive controls for non-technical users.

## Technologies Used
### **Frontend**
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- React.js (for UI management)
- MediaPipe Pose / OpenPose (for pose detection)

### **Backend & Data Storage**
- Firebase / Node.js (for managing clothing assets)
- LocalStorage (for storing user preferences)

### **Machine Learning & Graphics**
- TensorFlow.js (for real-time processing)
- WebGL & Three.js (for rendering and optimization)

## Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/virtual-trial-room.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd virtual-trial-room
   ```
3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. **Run the project locally:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## How It Works
1. **Webcam Activation**: The user grants webcam access to capture live video input.
2. **Pose Detection**: The system analyzes body landmarks in real time.
3. **Clothing Selection**: The user picks a garment from the catalog.
4. **Virtual Overlay**: The selected clothing is resized and mapped to the detected pose.
5. **Customization**: Users can adjust size, fit, and add accessories.
6. **Final Review**: The user can save, share, or proceed to checkout.

## System Requirements
- **Hardware:** A standard webcam, GPU-enabled system (recommended for optimal performance)
- **Software:** Modern web browsers (Chrome, Edge, Firefox) with WebGL support

## Future Enhancements
- **Improved Occlusion Handling** for more natural clothing fit.
- **Fabric Physics Simulation** to enhance realism.
- **Multi-Camera Support** for better angle adjustments.
- **Cloud-Based Processing** for lower-end device compatibility.
